Hackmaster 3000
===============

This is our 24 Hours of Good Google hackathon project. The goal was to make a game that teaches users to not trust public computers, so we made a hacker tycoon game!

Made in 24 hours by team arm-chip-skateboard:
* Jimmy Bouker
* Andriy Duyko
* Mark Fielbig
* Angad Sidhu

You can play the game [here](http://mfiels.github.io/arm-chip-skateboard/).
